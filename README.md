### Mobile

1. Install a mobile browser like [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_US&gl=US) that supports chrome extensions.  I know what you're thinking, and the answer is 'no, the chrome browser on android does not support chrome extensions'.

3. In the menu click `Extensions`.

4. On the `Extensions` page enable `Developer Mode` using the toggle in the top right corner of the browser.
